## URI vs URL vs URN

`` TODO:
    there's confusion whether to use 'universal' or 'uniform' in the abbreviation of the acronym. This needs to be cleared.
``

- __URI__(Uniform Resource Identifier): It identifies a resource either by location, or a name, or both.

    eg: http://www.example.org/Icons/home <br />
    In the above case, home icon is identified by it's location, which is pretty unique, however no details about the type of resource its pointing is provided.(.jpg or .png or .GIF).
